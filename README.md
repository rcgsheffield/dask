# Dask

[Dask](https://www.dask.org/) is a framework written in the Python programming language that is based on SciPy and designed for parallel computing, compatible with HPC task schedulers, used to scale up scientific computing.

This repository are some examples of using Dask on High Performance Computing and optimising performance on the [HPC facilities at The University of Sheffield](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/).
